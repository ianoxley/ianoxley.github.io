This is just meant as a reminder for me, as I can never remember the colour values to use when trying to add that yellow highlight colour to some CSS (in fact, even as I'm writing this the WordPress permalink editor is taunting me with that very same colour).

So, without further ado:

  * Hex: **background:#FFFBCC;**
  * RGB:Â **background:rgb(255, 251, 204);**

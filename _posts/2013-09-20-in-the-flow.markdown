I've been lucky enough to get an invite to a free trial of Safari Flow, a new
offering from the team behind Safari Books Online. It gives you online access
to the O'Reilly catalogue, but with a slight twist: rather than you selecting
whole books to read at a time, you can pick and choose chapters, and get
recommended chapters, based on what you're interests and reading history.

You're still free to read whole books at a time, but this 'interest led'
approach to recommending sections of books is interesting and has already led
to me reading some great stuff that I might not have ordinarily come across.

The reading interface is nice and clean, and allows you to customise the size
of the font to your taste. It looks good on mobile devices too.

A really nice feature of Safari Flow is it gives you estimated reading times
for the book sections. This is great if you're looking for something to read
but aren't sure what as it helps you: choose something quick to read if you're
short of time; or choose something longer containing more in-depth material if
you've got more time available. Plus, if you're part of the way through
a section, you'll get a nice little infographic indicating what proportion
you've read and how long it'll take you to finish it.

I'm really impressed with Safari Flow, and will be intersted to see how it
develops over the coming months and years.

Getting Things Done feels like it has been around for ages now. I remember
reading about it first back around 2007, when it was geek dejoure. I tried
various different implementations of it, from todo.txt, to using Remember The
Milk, to the PigPog PDA, to just writing todo lists in a notebook. Like
anything that's worth doing, it's too easy to stop. I can't remember exactly
when I stopped using GTD. But recently I've started using it again, and
immediately felt the difference it made. The main benefit of using it isn't
having todo lists for this, that, and the other. The main benefit is ideas. It
felt like I hadn't had an idea for ages. But as soon as I'd got everything
written down, as soon as I'd got everything into my 'trusted system', I kept
getting these ideas. The kept coming, and coming. I'd write them down. All of
them. Then I'd get some more. Where had they all come from? I think it's
alluded to in the book: the fact that writing actions, and todo lists, and
everything else, down in your trusted system frees your mind up from having to
remember stuff. That's the main benefit for me.

I tried using other approaches to getting things done. Things like creating
a list of 3 things I had to get done per day, week, etc. But found that things
kept slipping through the cracks with this approach. I feel I'm much more
effective when I'm using the full GTD system.

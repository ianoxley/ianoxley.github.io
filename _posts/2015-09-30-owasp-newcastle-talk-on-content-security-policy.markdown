description: My slides from my OWASP Newcastle talk on Content Security Policy
---

On Tuesday 29 September 2015 I gave a talk at [OWASP Newcastle](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Newcastle) on Content Security Policy (my [slides are available on Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/ianoxley/content-security-policy)).

It was an enjoyable evening, with some interesting talks from the other speakers: John Beddard on Securing Real-Time Networks, Mike Goodwin on Threat Dragon - a new threat modelling tool project from OWASP, and Neil Dixley on the OWASP Top 10 Mobile Risks.

I don't normally think twice about printer test pages. And, to be honest, who does? But I was setting up a new printer at home the other day on my laptop, which dual boots into Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala) and Windows 7 and couldn't help but notice that stark contrast between the Windows 7 printer test page and it's Ubuntu counterpart:

I know which one I find more useful and informative :)

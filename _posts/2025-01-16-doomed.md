I've dabbled with Emacs off and on over the years, but it's never really stuck and I've ended up going back to Vim. I had another go with [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) towards the end of last year and...I'm still using it now months later!

I'm not entirely sure why, although I think these things helped:

- LSP support
- Lots of Doom modules have flags to add additional functionality e.g. `(ruby +rails +rbenv +lsp)` to add Rails, rbenv support, and add LSP integration to the Ruby module
- [Projectile](https://docs.projectile.mx/projectile/index.html)
- Setting up the built in terminal emulator to use vterm
- Org Mode

Well, it's not really [5-a-day](http://www.5aday.nhs.uk/topTips/default.html) - not unless I only reply to one e-mail a day :-). It's [five.sentenc.es ](http://five.sentenc.es/)

I have been struggling with attaining [Inbox Zero](http://www.43folders.com/izero) recently and Mike Davidson's thoughts on the [work imbalance between the sender and receiver](http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2007/07/fight-email-overload-with-sentences) struck a chord with me.

So I am taking a leaf out of his book and following the [five.sencenc.es](http://five.sentenc.es/) mantra from today with all my e-mail.

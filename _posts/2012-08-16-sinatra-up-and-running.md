Sinatra Up and Running is a good read both for web developers who want to start building web applications with Sinatra, and for experiencedRuby developers who want to learn how Sinatra works under the covers.

The book is organised with the above in mind, making it easy to find the information you need. The first part covers the basics of Sinatra and focuses on giving you the knowledge you'll need to start writing your own Sinatra powered web applications. Part two gets more technical, and looks at how Sinatra works under the covers, how you can write your own helpers and extensions, how Sinatra can be used as Rack middleware, and you can use it to create modular applications. The final part ties everything together and walks the reader through creating a Sinatra powered blog.

I enjoyed reading Sinatra: Up and Running. It's well written, and full of code samples to help give you a better understanding of the concepts discussed. If you're looking for a book on Sinatra then I'd recommend this one without hesitation.

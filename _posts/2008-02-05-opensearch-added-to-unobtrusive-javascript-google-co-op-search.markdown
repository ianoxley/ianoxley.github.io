I have added [OpenSearch](http://www.opensearch.org) to my Google Co-op Search Engine [Unobtrusive JavaScript](http://www.strongasanox.co.uk/http://www.strongasanox.co.uk/unobtrusivejavascript/). Now you use the search engine in [OpenSearch aware browsers](http://www.getfirefox.com) you can add it to the browser's search box.

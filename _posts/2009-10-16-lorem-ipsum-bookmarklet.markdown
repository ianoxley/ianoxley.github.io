I often use a couple of paragraphs of Lipsum when testing forms containing `<textarea>` tags and have had this bookmarklet I cobbled together sitting on my Bookmarks Toolbar for a while now.

Anyway, I thought it might be fun to hook it up to a HTML 5 form to let you customise how many paragraphs of Lipsum you want each time you click it. So that's what I went and did:

[Lorem Ipsum Bookmarklet Generator](http://www.strongasanox.co.uk/lorem-ipsum-bookmarklet-generator/)

Hopefully it'll save you a few mouse clicks next time you're testing some forms.

(Please note that the form used in the generator uses the `<input type="range" />` HTML 5 tag which currently works best in the [latest version of Opera](http://www.opera.com/browser/).  YMMV when using other browsers).

I've had an article published on [JSPro.com](http://JSPro.com), SitePoint's new
site for all things JavaScript. My article is on Bower, the browser package
manager, and covers installing it, using it to install, update, and
delete packages, and how you can publish your own packages. 

You can read it here: [Package Management for the Browser with
Bower](http://jspro.com/toolsandlibraries/package-management-for-the-browser-with-bower/).

Quite often, when buying books off Amazon, you can sometimes get them cheaper by going to a marketplace seller's own website. That's how I came across [The Book Depository](http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/), where I have bought a few books recently.

One nice UX feature that I like on this site was the way in which they highlight where to find your credit card CVV/security number depending on which credit card you are using:

![Visa card with CVV number highlighted](http://www.strongasanox.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/visa_cvv-300x206.jpg)

The image above shows the security number highlighted on the signature strip when you select Visa from the credit card type drop-down list. Compare that with the screenshot below showing the security number highlighted on the _front_ of the card when American Express is selected:

![AMEX card with the CVV number highlighted](http://www.strongasanox.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/amex_cvv-300x206.jpg)

It's a simple feature really, but nicely implemented.

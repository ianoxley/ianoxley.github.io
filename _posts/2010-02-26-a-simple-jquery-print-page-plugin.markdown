The other day I was after a really simple way to add a _print page_ link to a page to, well, er, print it.  So I came up with my jQuery Print Page plugin and stuck it on GitHub with a demo page: [http://github.com/ianoxley/jqueryprintpage](http://github.com/ianoxley/jqueryprintpage)

This really is nothing fancy: it's just a convenient way of adding an `<a>` tag plus an event-handler to a page to print it. Using it is as simple as, well, using File -> Print. But you can't style the File menu with CSS so this is much more fun :-)

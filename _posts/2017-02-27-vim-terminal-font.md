After years running Vim on both OS X and Windows, I'd got used to setting fonts
and colour schemes via `gvimrc`. But today, as I setup my new machine in my [new
job](http://www.sageone.com), I couldn't remember how on earth you change the font in Vim when running
it in Terminal.

As it turns out, you can't.

When run via the console / terminal, Vim uses the same font that the terminal*
uses.

No wonder I couldn't remember how to set it :)

_* Changing the font in your terminal in OS X is done via Terminal ->
Preferences_

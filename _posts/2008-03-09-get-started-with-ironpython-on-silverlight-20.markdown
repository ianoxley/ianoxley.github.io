If you want to have a go with IronPython on Silverlight 2.0, you could do worse than to follow [the advice in this article](http://silverlight.net/quickstarts/ProgramDlr.aspx). Although the example is rather simplistic it should get you up and running in no time.

As the Chiron tool is in the Microsoft SDK's folder, I am presuming that you will need to install the Silverlight 2.0 SDK first (as well as the Silverlight 2.0 runtime of course). These can be downloaded from here:

Have fun!

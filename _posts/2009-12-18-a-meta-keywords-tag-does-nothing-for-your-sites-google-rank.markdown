Are you fed up with so called SEO experts extolling the importance of meta "keywords" tags on a site's Google rank? Me too. I therefore createdÂ [doesgoogleusethekeywordsmetatag.com](http://doesgoogleusethekeywordsmetatag.com/).

So the next time anyone moans about their site's lack of a keywords meta tag, you know where to send them :-)

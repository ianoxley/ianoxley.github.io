I have been playing around with [Google Co-op](http://www.google.com/coop/) recently and have created [Unobtrusive JavaScript](http://www.strongasanox.co.uk/javascriptsearch/): a custom search engine that focuses on unobtrusive JavaScript knowledge and tips from leading JavaScript experts. Please give it a try and let me know what you think.

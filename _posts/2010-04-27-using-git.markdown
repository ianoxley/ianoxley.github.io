Since going freelance at the end of last month I made the conscious decision to use [Git](http://git-scm.com/) for my source control on freelance projects. I'd kind of used it a bit when adding stuff to [GitHub](http://github.com/) but hadn't really used it in anger on anything. Until now. And so far so good.

Quite a nifty little cheatsheet I found was this: [http://cheat.errtheblog.com/s/git](http://cheat.errtheblog.com/s/git)

I really like the aliases and colour-coding - simple stuff but these save you a lot of typing / keystrokes and make it easier to see at a glance what's what respectively :)
